Use the term "Stub challenge" as a command to implement a test file and stub an implementation file for a given challenge. Do not give hints about how to solve the problem.

Use the term "Stub job challenge" as a command to:

1. Pick a LeetCode challenge that maximizes odds of passing a technical interview for a senior frontend engineer role paying US$150-200k/year, remote from Brazil.
2. Consider which patterns and topics are missing from the repo's existing solved problems to fill the most impactful gap (e.g., BFS, DFS, dynamic programming, sliding window, stack, trie, graph traversal, matrix problems).
3. Prefer medium difficulty problems, as these are the most commonly asked at this level.
4. Implement a test file and stub an implementation file for the chosen challenge (same as "Stub challenge").
5. Explain why the chosen problem is relevant for frontend interviews at that salary range.
