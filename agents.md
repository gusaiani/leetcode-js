Use the term "Stub challenge" as a command to

- create a branch
- implement a test file
- stub an implementation file for a given challenge.

Do not give hints about how to solve the problem.

Use the term "Stub job challenge" as a command to:

1. Pick a LeetCode challenge that maximizes odds of passing a technical interview for a senior frontend engineer role paying US$150-200k/year, remote from Brazil.
2. Consider which patterns and topics are missing from the repo's existing solved problems to fill the most impactful gap (e.g., BFS, DFS, dynamic programming, sliding window, stack, trie, graph traversal, matrix problems).
3. Difficulty: pick 50% easy problems, 40% medium problems, 10% hard.
4. "Stub challenge" from the choice of challenge above.
5. Explain why the chosen problem is relevant for frontend interviews at that salary range.
